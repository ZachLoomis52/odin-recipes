    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>The Costco Chicken Bake is a hot, savory snack known for its crispy, golden-brown exterior and indulgent filling. 
        Wrapped in pizza dough, it's stuffed with tender, diced chicken, smoky bacon, melted mozzarella cheese, 
        and creamy Caesar dressing. Baked to perfection, the outside is brushed with an egg wash and sprinkled with parmesan, 
        giving it a flavorful crust that contrasts with the gooey, cheesy interior. Each bite delivers a satisfying combination 
        of rich, savory flavors and textures, making it a popular grab-and-go meal at Costco's food court.</p>
