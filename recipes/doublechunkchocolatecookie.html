    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The Costco Double Chunk Chocolate Cookie is a decadent treat known for its rich, indulgent flavor and soft, chewy texture. 
        Each cookie is generously packed with two types of chocolate—large chocolate chunks and semi-sweet chips—creating a rich, 
        fudgy interior. The outside has a slightly crisp edge, while the inside remains gooey and dense, with bursts of melted 
        chocolate in every bite. Perfect for chocolate lovers, the cookie balances sweetness with a deep cocoa flavor, making it 
        both a satisfying dessert and a luxurious snack.</p>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat 1 cup of softened unsalted butter, 1 cup of granulated 
            sugar, and 1 cup of packed brown sugar until light and fluffy</li>
        <li>Beat in 2 large eggs, one at a time, then add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and mix until combined</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 
            teaspoon baking soda, and ½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Avoid overmixing</li>
        <li>Gently fold in 1 ½ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 ½ cups chocolate chunks</li>
        <li>Scoop out dough portions (about 2 tablespoons each) and place them on the prepared baking sheet, 
            leaving space between each cookie</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set and the centers look slightly underbaked
